# Name comparator

Website to allow upcoming parents to compare their chosen name with other parents to be, without sharing the actual names.

It takes a name as input and returns the first part of an SHA-224 hash of that name, after being stripped from accents, non-word characters and captitalization.

## Used technology

This website is built with Next.js (React), is statically served and runs entirely in the browser.

## About the code

There's over 16 million possible codes (16^6), so on a collision – two times the same code – you know with 99.9999999404% (100-1/16^6) certainty that the same name was used.
